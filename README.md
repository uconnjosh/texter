##Build for practice using the Twilio api within Rails, part of the Epicodus curriculum.
###To use, you will need to:
1. Copy the URL and run: rake db:clone
2. Run rake db:schema:migrate
3. Have a Twilio account and enter your credentials into the .env file.
4. If you only have a free Twilio account, the 'from:' field will need to be your Twilio number, and the 'to:' field will need to be a Twilio verified number.
